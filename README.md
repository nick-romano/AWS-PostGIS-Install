<h1>PostGIS database installation on an AWS free tier instance</h1>

This is a paper I wrote outlining the installation of PostGIS on AWS:
https://github.com/nick-romano/AWS-PostGIS-Install/blob/master/instructions/Paper.pdf


I also attached a node app that I made to query the DB. I left the credentials out of the app. so it won't work, but the query objects in the app.js & foo.js files can be used as reference for how to query a spatial DB from a node hosted http application.

You can also connect to the remote postGIS database in QGIS.
